<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>The Only Story</B></P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At dinnertime my wife often says to our
two girls, “Tell us about your day.”  And the response:
“Everything, jelly, kickball, gum, inky tongue, stinky Band Aids,
is sexy a bad word, there’s more—”   There’s often some very
good stuff in there, but you’ve got to listen long and concentrate.
 I mean <I>really</I> concentrate.   
</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So one day I had an idea.  Simple
really.  “Tell us <I>one</I> thing about your day.  Not two.  Not
ten.  Only one.”</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only <I>one</I>?  
</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their minds went busy—sifting the day
for gold.  And then one of them spoke: hugging a friend at recess
because both were sad about time outs.  And then the next daughter
said hers: a worm cracking on a sunny path, carrying the dried-out
body to a puddle.  And the family was engrossed.  We tried Only One
again the next night.  And a week later. And here’s what I learned:
limit people to <I>one</I> thing and you get their most important
thing. <I> </I>And this is what happens next: everyone wants to
listen. 
</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And this got me thinking.   The grownup
world is much like the kid world.  Just our babble comes in the form
of emails, text messages and Facebook posts.  Coworkers and
advertisers, old high school friends and celebrities, all saying,
Listen to me, this is important.  And how do people get heard above
the noise?  They use exclamation points!  They post to Twitter four
times a day.  They all send <I>more</I>.  And yet, how I crave a
world that is simple.  A world where priorities are clear and inboxes
empty.</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What would happen, I wondered, if
grownups could say only one thing?  Would they say only what
mattered?</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I told a few friends I had a big idea. 
A messaging service where you can send only one message per month.  
</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They responded, “That’s
preposterous” and “You’re kidding, right?” and “You realize
that with Gmail and Facebook I get <I>unlimited</I> messages.  And I
can text too.” 
</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I said, “That’s my point.  Those
are junk delivery systems.  Do you really want to say, <I><B>I’ve
always loved you</B></I><I> </I>with a text?  Do you want to send a
condolence with email?  But if you could send only one message, using
your Only One would be your personal stamp of meaning.”  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">My friend looked away from my eyes, and
asked, “How are the girls?”</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet, I thought, they are wrong.  They
don’t understand because they have never played the Only One
dinnertime game with their kids. 
</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day I sketched out the app.  A
button here, a stamp there.  And I persuaded myself, <I>this isn’t
stupid at all.  I’m not the only one who wants simplicity. 
Clarity.  Meaning</I>!  And so I hired some people to make my
sketches real.  
</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now that the app is done, I wonder,
in this world of unlimited free messaging, is Only One the dumbest
idea ever?  Or is it actually a brilliant solution to the problem of
inky-tongue-stinky-band-aids?   I honestly do not know, and suspect
it is both.</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so we shall find out.
